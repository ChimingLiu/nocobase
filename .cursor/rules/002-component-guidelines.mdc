# Component Guidelines

- **File Structure**:
  - Each component should reside in its own folder within `src/components/`.
  - Include related files such as styles and tests within the same folder.

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Use PascalCase for component names.
  - Suffix component files with `.tsx`.

- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for each component using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Ensure tests cover various states and interactions of the component.
