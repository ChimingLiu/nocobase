# Global Project Guidelines

- **TypeScript Practices**:
  - Enforce strict typing with explicit type definitions.
  - Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes.
  - Avoid the use of `any`; strive for precise types.

- **React Guidelines**:
  - Employ functional components exclusively.
  - Utilize React hooks for state and side effects management.
  - Ensure components are reusable and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

- **Ant Design Integration**:
  - Import Ant Design components as needed to optimize bundle size.
  - Customize Ant Design themes to align with project branding.

- **CSS-in-JS Styling**:
  - Use a CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., styled-components or @emotion/styled) for component styling.
  - Define styles within the same file as the component for better cohesion.
  - Avoid inline styles; encapsulate styles within styled components or equivalent.
